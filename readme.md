#Automata Library

This library is intended simulate an automata, in particular a Finite State Machine. 
It executes that machine on a string (list of symbols), the result of the execution is whether the automata accepts or rejects that string


Using this construction, it gives the possibility to construct regular expressions on some locales and match them against strings
